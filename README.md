# guessTheNo

This is a small game(Guess the no.) made by me after learning from  udemy course.

1.You just have to enter your guesses into the box and enter CHECK.
2.If your guess no.matches with the secret no.under question mark symbol,you wins the game.
3.keep on entering your guess and once your guess gets matched,your high score will be displayed which is equals to the no.of attempts left.(score=highscore).
